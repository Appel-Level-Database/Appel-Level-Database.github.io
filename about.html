			<h2>About Appel Level Database</h2>
			<p>
				<h3>What is Appel Level Database?</h3>
				Appel Level Database is a website where you can upload and share your Appel levels with other people. Copying level codes is very simple, just click the Copy button, and you're good to go!
				<h3>I can't load a level!</h3>
				This may happen because you tried loading an incompatible level in the Vanilla Appel. When you find a level, make sure it has "Vanilla Appel-compatible" on it. If not, then load your level in Appel Multiplayer. If it has "Compatibility unknown" then the level is probably for a custom Appel mod.

			<h2>Rules</h2>
			<p>
				<h3>1. Please follow Scratch's Community Guidelines</h3>
				Appel is a Scratch game, and because of that, we don't want anything that breaks the Scratch Community Guidelines. You may never know if we decide to give a link for other Scratchers to this website or not. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/community_guidelines">Read Scratch's Community Guidelines</a>
				<h3>2. No NSFW/18+ content</h3>
				Keep in mind that not everyone is over the age 18, therefore don't upload and/or publish 18+ and NSFW content.
				<h3>3. No inappropriate structures</h3>
				Please don't build inappropriate structures in your levels. These levels will get taken down.
				<h3>4. Don't submit impossible levels</h3>
				Levels are great and fun, but please make them beatable. If they are impossible, please don't upload them.
